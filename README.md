# EmojiInsight


## Project Overview
This project explores how emojis can simplify and enhance the process of creating prompts for AI image generation. I aim to analyze existing datasets to determine if emojis can substitute or augment written prompts, predict user expectations, and recommend emojis based on user selections. Additionally, I'll explore the card and gifting industry's performance to gain market insights.
